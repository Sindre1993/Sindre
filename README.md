# Hello, I'm Sindre!

Currently studying Front-End development at Noroff. I'm based in Sandnes, Norway.

I received a sudden urge to learn programming around 2020 and started studying it August 2021, and have had a blast doing so!
I've had the chance to work on my own projects, and update them as my knowledge grows.

Currently looking to expand my Javascript skills and get into React.
